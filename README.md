# FABHeadLibraries

These are component libraries for designing FABtotum DIY heads.

Currently it contains a symbol and footprint library for the pogo pins in a FABtotum head (and corresponding 3D WRL models including FreeCAD source).

For historical reasons, there are 2 components, one "no_motor" having 4 pogo connectors (4 pins each) and one full connector (5 pogo connectors).

Note If you use the 4 connector version, you will not have 24VDC at the head other than the extruder, which is PWM!!

It is not very neat, but usable
